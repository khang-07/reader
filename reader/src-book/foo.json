  ],
  [
    "\"No matter,\" Crow says",
    "\"You really need this money and you're going to get it—beg, borrow, or steal",
    "It's your father's money, so who cares, right? Get your hands on that much and you should be able to make it",
    "For the time being",
    "But what's the plan after it's all gone? Money isn't like mushrooms in a forest—it doesn't just pop up on its own, you know",
    "You'll need to eat, a place to sleep",
    "One day you're going to run out.\""

    "\"No two ways around it.\""
  ],

    "I don't want to rain on your parade or anything, but I wouldn't count on escaping this place if I were you",
    "No matter how far you run",
    "Distance might not solve anything.\""

  ],
  [
    "\"All right,\" I say",

    "Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions",
    "You change direction but the sandstorm chases you",
    "You turn again, but the storm adjusts."
  ],
  [
    "Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn."
  ],
  [
    "Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you",
    "This storm is you",
    "Something inside of you",
    "So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step",
    "There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time",
    "Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones",
    "That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine."
  ],
  [
    "And that's exactly what I do",
    "I imagine a white funnel stretching up vertically like a thick rope",
    "My eyes are closed tight, hands cupped over my ears, so those fine grains of sand can't blow inside me",
    "The sandstorm draws steadily closer",
    "I can feel the air pressing on my skin",
    "It really is going to swallow me up."
  ],

    "\"From now on—no matter what—you've got to be the world's toughest fifteen-year-old",
    "That's the only way you're going to survive",
    "And in order to do that, you've got to figure out what it means to be tough",
    "You following me?\""
  ],
  [
    "I keep my eyes closed and don't reply",

    "I hear the faint flutter of wings."
  ],

    "Like he was carving the words in a deep blue tattoo on my heart."
  ],

    "And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm",
    "No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades",
    "People will bleed there, and you will bleed too",
    "Hot, red blood",
    "You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others."
  ],
  [
    "And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive",
    "You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over",
    "But one thing is certain",
    "When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in",
    "That's what this storm's all about."
